          So that we can all be happy. Besides none of us want to be alone. 
          And I know you are getting older and will need to be taken care of. 
          And I hope I can be the one to do that for you. You're my inspiration
          and I have learned so many good things because of you. I have faith I can
           do this becauseof you. <span class="special">WE LOVE YOU!!</span>
